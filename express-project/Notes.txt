REST APIs

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

* Use existing standards of the web (HTTP, JSON, URL)
* Endpoints are collection of data
* We use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* Client and server
* Requests are both stateless and cacheable

CRUD
Stand for Create Read Update Delete

CRUD goes hand in hand with the http methods.
## POST --> Create
## GET --> Read
## PUT/PATCH --> Update
## DELETE --> Delete
